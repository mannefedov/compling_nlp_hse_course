Поверхносто это будет из-за того, что это новый метод, который к тому же не до конца публичный. RLHF был разработан OpenAI и именно он позволил достичь сильного прироста в качестве генеративных моделей, которое можно наблюдать в ChatGPT. OpenAI не раскрывают всех деталей того, как они этого добились. Есть только обобщенные описание того, как это все работает и большая часть научного/инженерного сообщества в NLP сейчас пытается возпроизвести RLHF. \n",

    "### Reinforcement learning \n",
    "Прежде чем разбирать RLHF давайте коротко разберем, что такое Reinforcement learning в целом. RL - это отдельная парадигма в машинном обучении наряду с supervised и unsupervised learning. RL похоже на supervised learning, но модель в нем обучается не на конкретных примерах, а используя положительную/отрицательную обратную связь на свои действия от среды. \n",
    "Например, RL применяется в играх (от шахмат до доты) и в робототехнике. В принципе можно обучить supervised модель на действиях людей в игре или в управлении роботом, но тогда получается, что модель будет учиться имитировать людей, а не искать оптимальное решение. В этих задачах можно обойтись и без людей, так как можно автоматически оценить успешность/не успешность - в игре это очки или победа, в роботике это может быть, например, перемещение предмета из точки а в точку б. Обобщоно RL можно представить вот так:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0514_Reinforceme1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Модель учиться предсказывать действия в конкретной ситуации так, чтобы в итоге прийти к успеху (в игре действия могут быть движение вниз или вверх, а конкретной ситуацией может быть текущий экран). Изначально модель совершает рандомные действия, но постепенно у нее накапливаются последовательности действий, которые ведут к успеху и она начинает их повторять (и избегать тех, которые ведут к поражению).\n",
    "На практике это может быть очень сложно, так как часто в играх количество потенциально возможных последовательностей очень большое и модель просто не может случайно найти правильные последовательности,и требуется использовать какие-то трюки, специфичные для задачи (например, можно обучать модели играть друг против друга, чтобы можно было играть много игр парралельно в ускоренном режиме и не зависеть от людей). Сейчас RL это по большей части исследовательская область и есть даже мнения, что в итоге RL окажется не нужен (например, так считает Le Cun). Но в некоторых конкретных задачах, RL получилось успешно применить. В том числе, кажется, успешен он и для улучшение языковых моделей."

    "### Как можно применить RL к языковым моделям?\n",
    "При генерации текста у нас нет среды, которая могла бы оценить качество текста. Точнее она есть (это человек), но использовать ее напрямую затруднительно, поэтому в RLHF создается отедльная модель, которая будет имитировать человека и оценивать сгенерированные тексты. Такая модель обучается на датасете, который размечается людьми. Сначала с помощью языковой модели генерируется какое-то количество текстов и людей просят выбрать лучшие из них, чтобы сопоставить каждому тексту какое-то число (усредненная оценка). Затем обучается модель, которая предсказывает такие оценки. И на финальном шаге с RL обучаемая генеративная модель генерирует текст и он оценивается с помощью модели обученной на обратной связи от людей. Модель дообучается так, чтобы генерированные тексты получали высокие оценки."

Важно про него понимать то, что модель не просто учится максимизировать оценку генерированных текстов, она при этом еще старается минимизировать изменения. В простом fine-tuning частая проблема это то, что дообучаемая модель со временем начинает забывать и теряет в качестве, PPO позволяет этого избежать."

Этот метод является в какой-то степени оптимизацией RLHF. Авторы отталкиваются от RLHF c PPO, но с помощью хитрых математических преобразований приходят к лоссу, в котором не нужен RL и не нужна reward модель. В DPO можно обучать модель сразу на фидбек данных (обычно это пары chosen-rejected) как с обычным supervised обучением, но в лоссе в еще сохраняется отсылка к reference модели, чтобы при обучении модель не переобучалась и не забывала то, что она уже знает. \n",

The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyberattacks on the United States and its allies.\\n\\nMunoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.\\n\\nChavez has called the report \"lies.\"\\n\\nOne of the Iranian diplomats told Univision that although he, indeed, was presented with a hacking plot by the Mexican group, he turned it down, in part because he thought they were CIA agents.\\n\\nIn a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Rep. David Rivera, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Albio Sires asked the State Department to require Acosta's \"immediate departure\" from the United States if the Univision report proved true.\\n\\nLast month a State Department spokesman said the United States did not know about the alleged plot, but that it found the Univision allegations \"very disturbing.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"we don't have any information, at this point, to corroborate it,\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.\\n\\nCNN's Jill Dougherty, Juan Carlos Lopez and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.\\n\\nMost popular stories right now\\n\\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

Article: Welcome to one of the largest collections of footwear in the world that will make you green with envy. Here at the Footwear Museum you can see exhibits from all over the world. You can find out about shoes worn by everyone from the Ancient Egyptians to pop stars. Room 1 The celebrity footwear section is probably the most popular in the entire museum. Started in the 1950s there is a wide variety of shoes and boots belonging to everyone from queens and presidents to pop stars and actors! Most visitors find the celebrities' choice of footwear extremely interesting. Room 2 Most of our visitors are amazed--and shocked--by the collection of \"special purpose\" shoes on exhibition here at the Museum of Footwear. For example, there are Chinese shoes made of silk that were worn by women to tie their feet firmly to prevent them from growing too much! Room 3 As well as shoes and boots, the museum also exhibits shoeshaped objects. The variety is unbelievable. For example, there is a metal lamp that resembles a pair of shoes, and Greek wine bottles that look like legs! The Footwear Library People come from all over the world to study in our excellent footwear library. Designers and researchers come here to look up information on anything and everything related to the subject of footwear.

We had a work function here and it was quite delightful to visit this neat little museum tucked into the corner right adjacent to Old Montreal.  We started off the day with a light breakfast in the upstairs cafeteria which consisted of eggs, fruit and some french toast.  After you could go out on their balcony and get some views of the old port.  On our day there was a cruise ship within eye's view!      They have done an admirable job in keeping some of the history and original rock and brick of the past.  Artifacts behind glass are nice to gaze at to think of how time was many hundreds of years ago!  Next was a Pirate ship and tour and explanation for the kids which was done in interesting and curious fashion.     Finishing off the trip was a visit to their 2-D theatre in which you get an 18 minute history lesson of Montreal (available in French, English and Spanish)!  It's a nice finishing touch to make you leaving with a positive impression of Montreal.    I'd recommend this as a tourist attraction but some may be disappointed as it's a small museum.  I'd recommend not coming in here with huge expectations and you may be surprised or disappointed depending on your mood and temperament!\\nIs this review positive or negative?\\nChoose from:\\n (1). negative;\\n (2). positive;\\nAnswer:&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

All three best friends and Braithwaite's new love interest and soon to be fiancÃ©e Sophia Tardelli (played by Kasia Smutniak) suffer a car accident which puts MuÃ±ez out of contention through injuries. Meanwhile, Liam Adams discovers to his horror that he has a new daughter, Bella, from former love interest June (played by Anya Lahiri). This only adds to Liam's preexisting alcoholism and release from Real Madrid. It is revealed that MuÃ±ez is set to return to England as a Tottenham Hotspur player under a two-year contract, along with Liam, who re-signs for Newcastle United, the original club of both ex-Real players. The film goes on to depict the World Cup from the English perspective. Liam scores against Sweden (2-2), assisted by a header from Charlie, and England qualify for the knock-out stages. However, in the match against Ecuador, Charlie is injured, and later collapses in the changing room. He is rushed to hospital, and dies on the way from an aneurysm (from the car accident). England crash out of the quarter-finals against Portugal as Liam misses a crucial penalty against Portuguese keeper Ricardo while Cristiano Ronaldo converts. Liam later proposes June to marry him. Santiago Munez is the Best Man. During his wedding speech he remembers Charlie and his eyes get teary. As confetti is thrown on Liam and June, Italy are shown lifting the World Cup Trophy after beating France on penalties in the final. Also following the tournament around Germany in their St. George's Cross festooned camper van are the \"Geordie Boys\", who first appeared back in the first \"Goal!\"...\\nAnswer:&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter). This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade. This is where the shade becomes all your own. Use one style of material for a battered, distressed look or use all types of coordinating colors and patterns. Just make sure they're long enough!  Add one extra inch for the seam allowance. This is needed to wrap around the wire frame.  If your lamp is 20\" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22\" (56 cm) wide. You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing. Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too. If each strip of fabric is 2\" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready. This ensures that it stays neat, doesn't fray, and looks professional. The edges will only be seen from the inside of your lamp. If you're pressed for time or simply can't be bothered, a simple trim is fine. Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Repeat for the bottom.  If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished. If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view. You can gather the material together if you stapled or used a needle and thread. Adjust the material to achieve the look you want. Beads, tassles, or extra ribbon can be added onto the top and bottom of your shade to hide any less-than-perfect areas or simply to add more flair.&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

Which area is less likely to have acid rain?  Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum.  Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.\\nAnswer:&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

The decision to release the prisoners follows \"numerous requests\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \"important\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \"generosity and strength of the revolution.\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Why was Alan Gross sentence to jail?\"\\n\\nResponse: \"He was accused of drug trafficking\"\\n\\nBased on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?\\n\\nChoose your answer from:\\n a). no.\\n b). yes.&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send Me\", \"Wonderful World\", \"Chain Gang\", and \"Twistin' the Night Away\".\\n\\nCooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931. In 1957 he added an \"e\" at the end of his name to signify a new start to his life. He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932-2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents.  The family moved to Chicago in 1933. Cooke attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago, the same school that Nat \"King\" Cole had attended a few years earlier. Sam Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. He first became known as lead singer with the Highway QC's when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group.  In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, founded by Harris, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song \"Jesus Gave Me Water\" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs \"Peace in the Valley\", \"How Far Am I from Canaan?\", \"Jesus Paid the Debt\" and \"One More River\", among many others, some of which he wrote.

Context: Overnight the clouds had rolled in and the summer was dead. I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain. Somebody knocked at the door and I swiveled around to see Pete McGreggor from down the hall. \"Busy?\" he asked. I shook my head and he came in, closing the door behind him. He poured a cup of coffee and sat down across from me. \"Big shakeup last night,\" he said. \"I just got a call to defend one of the Preacher's errand boys.\" \"So they finally got to him,\" I said, remembering the furor that had raged in the newspapers a few months before. The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \"How'd they do it?\" \"It's very hush-hush,\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess. But what I gather is that the thing was pulled off from the inside, from somebody high up in the organization. But nobody knows exactly who it was that sold out.\" \"It'll all come clean at the trial, I suppose.\" He nodded. \"Sooner than that, I expect. The DA told me confidentially that they'll have everything they need by five o'clock tonight. You'll see it all on the evening news.\" A sharp rapping came at the door and Pete stood up. \"You've got business. I'll leave you to it.\" \"It's probably bill collectors,\" I said. \"I'll yell if they get rough.\" He opened the door and pushed past the two policemen that were waiting outside. They were both in uniform, but I only knew one of them. That was Brady, the tall, curly headed one that looked like an Irish middleweight. His partner was dark and nondescript, sporting a Police Academy moustache.

With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent... contains an answer for the question: Who named Polyperchon as his successor?, what is it ?\\nAnswer:&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a tenor) is primo uomo.  - Elisabeth Olin née Lillström ( December 1740 -- 26 March 1828 ) , was a Swedish opera singer and a music composer . She performed the leading female role in the inauguration performance of the Royal Swedish Opera in 1773 , and is referred to as the first Swedish Opera prima donna . She was the first female to be made Hovsångare ( 1773 ) , and the first woman to become a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music ( 1782 ) .  - Opera (English plural: \"operas\"; Italian plural: \"opere\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \"tenor high C\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \"leggero\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.  - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \"high A\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \"soprano C\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'voice type' with the subject 'elisabeth olin'.

Jerry awakes just in time to avoid the 10-ball and is carried out to the ball return , where the 10 and the 13 smash the mouse between each other .  Jerry is mad and walks up through the pocket , first sees nothing , but after a few steps back to the pocket , he spots Tom perched behind it .  Jerry tries to jump into another corner pocket , but Tom aims a cue ball with so much force that it roll's into the pocket , and spins back out of it and it rolls Jerry backwards to Tom , who has made a ramp with his cue stick for the mouse to slide up .  Jerry stops at the top of the stick and is then blown down by Tom , who then shoots a stream of balls to make the mouse flat .  The whole train rebounds back towards the cat and the balls stack up at Tom's end of the table .  Tom shoots all the balls in succession with his cue , and then tries to shoot Jerry , but the mouse hangs onto the cue tip .  The cat , as if he were saying `` Have it your way '' , chalks up and shoots the 8-ball using Jerry .  The mouse drops off the cue tip and then is upended by the 8-ball rolling in circles , and Tom forces Jerry to jump through the ball rack as if he were a circus performer .  Tom then sets it on fire to add an additional level of torment , and when Jerry accomplishes this with poise , Tom discards the flaming rack and shoots the 8-ball across the table and back . \\n\\nQuestion: \"What makes Jerry to stop at the top of the stick?\"\\n\\nResponse: \"Because he slips\"\\n\\nBased on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one’s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.   Q: Deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) is nucleotide that stores what type of information?

It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&amp;R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \"What's the problem?\" Ray asked. \"I have a recalcitrant.\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural. \"Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business. To make them calcitrant.\" \"I know that.\" Pete sounded a little annoyed. There was some commotion in the background, a knocking on doors.

But the most rewarding reactions to the film, Cooper says, have been from veterans.\\n\\n“It's been incredible, just incredible the amount of response. It’s everything we could have possibly hoped for,” he said. “In the sense of people feeling like even though it's a movie it's accurate enough, and in terms of the emotional and sort of familial sort of sense of reality that it's completely accurate.\"\\n\\nMiller said having Taya on board was key.\\n\\n“She had tons of home videos and we read all of their email correspondence when he was on tour. She kept everything because she never knew whether he'd make it back,” Miller told FOX411. “You know, when you have access to that kind of information you get a side to someone that no one really ever sees. You see the family man, you see how loving he was, and I think that Bradley really brings that heart, that balance between him as the military man but also this soulful, loving father.\"\\n\\nCooper said playing Kyle provided insight into the lives of soldiers and their families.\\n\\n“It was a keyhole into that life,” he said. “One thing that we were able to do was explore this man's life and this woman's life and their children and their family and in doing so hopefully get just a nugget, a kernel of truth, that people who actually have gone through it and are going through it can relate to it and not feel alone.”\\n\\n“American Sniper” opens in theaters nationwide January 16th.\\n\\nFox News Entertainment Producer Ashley Dvorkin covers celebrity news, red carpets, TV, music, and movies.

Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox.  and the situation: Two families thought differently about vaccinations.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture.

The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige). The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside. To ensure Veronica's survival Balthazar traps her, with Morgana, in the Grimhold, a large nesting doll. Both facades of Veronica and Morgana are displayed on the outer shell. Before he dies, Merlin tells Balthazar that he must find the child that will be born endowed with all of his powers, the Prime Merlinian, and gives him a small, metal dragon; a symbol of his magic. The Prime Merlinian will be the only one to stop Morgana. Balthazar searches the globe for the Merlinian, with no success. Over time, he battles evil sorcerers and adds them, in layers, to the Grimhold until, finally, he captures Horvath and seals him in the outermost layer.Centuries pass to the year 2000. A young boy named David Stutler (Jake Cherry) wakes up for school, greeted by his bulldog puppy, Tank. He the bus into New York City with his classmates on a field trip and draws a picture on the window which, at the right moment, makes it look as if King...\\nA:&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n</td>\n",

The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyberattacks on the United States and its allies.\\n\\nMunoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.\\n\\nChavez has called the report \"lies.\"\\n\\nOne of the Iranian diplomats told Univision that although he, indeed, was presented with a hacking plot by the Mexican group, he turned it down, in part because he thought they were CIA agents.\\n\\nIn a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Rep.

Article: Welcome to one of the largest collections of footwear in the world that will make you green with envy. Here at the Footwear Museum you can see exhibits from all over the world. You can find out about shoes worn by everyone from the Ancient Egyptians to pop stars. Room 1 The celebrity footwear section is probably the most popular in the entire museum. Started in the 1950s there is a wide variety of shoes and boots belonging to everyone from queens and presidents to pop stars and actors! Most visitors find the celebrities' choice of footwear extremely interesting. Room 2 Most of our visitors are amazed--and shocked--by the collection of \"special purpose\" shoes on exhibition here at the Museum of Footwear. For example, there are Chinese shoes made of silk that were worn by women to tie their feet firmly to prevent them from growing too much! Room 3 As well as shoes and boots, the museum also exhibits shoeshaped objects. The variety is unbelievable. For example, there is a metal lamp that resembles a pair of shoes, and Greek wine bottles that look like legs! The Footwear Library People come from all over the world to study in our excellent footwear library. Designers and researchers come here to look up information on anything and everything related to the subject of footwear.

We had a work function here and it was quite delightful to visit this neat little museum tucked into the corner right adjacent to Old Montreal.  We started off the day with a light breakfast in the upstairs cafeteria which consisted of eggs, fruit and some french toast.  After you could go out on their balcony and get some views of the old port.  On our day there was a cruise ship within eye's view!      They have done an admirable job in keeping some of the history and original rock and brick of the past.  Artifacts behind glass are nice to gaze at to think of how time was many hundreds of years ago!  Next was a Pirate ship and tour and explanation for the kids which was done in interesting and curious fashion.     Finishing off the trip was a visit to their 2-D theatre in which you get an 18 minute history lesson of Montreal (available in French, English and Spanish)!  It's a nice finishing touch to make you leaving with a positive impression of Montreal.    I'd recommend this as a tourist attraction but some may be disappointed as it's a small museum.  I'd recommend not coming in here with huge expectations and you may be surprised or disappointed depending on your mood and temperament!\\nIs this review positive or negative?\\nChoose from:\\n (1). negative;\\n (2). positive;\\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Think like you are answering to a five year old.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nSammy's is our go-to, close to home, I don't feel like cooking kind of place. Portions are good, food is quality and fresh and the service is great. The restaurant is pretty small, but satisfactory for parties of 2-6. I wouldn't recommend this if you had a large group. Bar area is just \"meh\" so I wouldn't recommend Sammys if you want to watch sports and hang out at a bar. This is perfect for a lunch with coworkers, dinner with the kids or a causal couples dinner (not a date).  Some of our favorites are:  Hummus Appetizer Thai Chicken Satay Chinese Chicken Salad Pear & Arugula Pizza Sicilian Rustic Pizza Mahi Tacos Thai Chicken Salad  PS: for salads ALWAYS order a half order. They are huge.\\nIs this review positive or negative?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

All three best friends and Braithwaite's new love interest and soon to be fiancÃ©e Sophia Tardelli (played by Kasia Smutniak) suffer a car accident which puts MuÃ±ez out of contention through injuries. Meanwhile, Liam Adams discovers to his horror that he has a new daughter, Bella, from former love interest June (played by Anya Lahiri). This only adds to Liam's preexisting alcoholism and release from Real Madrid. It is revealed that MuÃ±ez is set to return to England as a Tottenham Hotspur player under a two-year contract, along with Liam, who re-signs for Newcastle United, the original club of both ex-Real players. The film goes on to depict the World Cup from the English perspective. Liam scores against Sweden (2-2), assisted by a header from Charlie, and England qualify for the knock-out stages. However, in the match against Ecuador, Charlie is injured, and later collapses in the changing room. He is rushed to hospital, and dies on the way from an aneurysm (from the car accident). England crash out of the quarter-finals against Portugal as Liam misses a crucial penalty against Portuguese keeper Ricardo while Cristiano Ronaldo converts. Liam later proposes June to marry him. Santiago Munez is the Best Man. During his wedding speech he remembers Charlie and his eyes get teary. As confetti is thrown on Liam and June, Italy are shown lifting the World Cup Trophy after beating France on penalties in the final. Also following the tournament around Germany in their St. George's Cross festooned camper van are the \"Geordie Boys\", who first appeared back in the first \"Goal!\"...\\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

How far is it around? If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter). This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade. This is where the shade becomes all your own. Use one style of material for a battered, distressed look or use all types of coordinating colors and patterns. Just make sure they're long enough!  Add one extra inch for the seam allowance. This is needed to wrap around the wire frame.  If your lamp is 20\" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22\" (56 cm) wide. You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing. Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too. If each strip of fabric is 2\" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready. This ensures that it stays neat, doesn't fray, and looks professional. The edges will only be seen from the inside of your lamp. If you're pressed for time or simply can't be bothered, a simple trim is fine. Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Repeat for the bottom.  If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished. If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view. You can gather the material together if you stapled or used a needle and thread. Adjust the material to achieve the look you want. Beads, tassles, or extra ribbon can be added onto the top and bottom of your shade to hide any less-than-perfect areas or simply to add more flair.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Which area is less likely to have acid rain?  Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum.  Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.\\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

What do you mean by treating this girl so rudely?\" \\n\\n\"You are following me,\" went on Ferris, ignoring the question which had been put to him. \\n\\n\"What if I am?\" \\n\\n\"You think you're smart, don't you?\" sneered Ferris. \\n\\n\"He's a mean, ugly thing!\" put in the girl, between her sobs. \"I wish he was arrested.\" \\n\\n\"Shut up!\" roared Ferris, turning to her. \"You ran into me on purpose.\" \\n\\n\"I didn't. We've got a right to coast in this alley; mamma said so.\" \\n\\n\"You ought to be arrested for striking the little girl,\" said Hal. \"I am awfully glad I arrived in the nick of time to save her from more punishment.\" \\n\\n\"Good fer you, mister!\" cried a small youth standing near. \"Give him one in der eye!\" \\n\\n\"Yes, do him up, mister,\" cried several others. \\n\\nFerris turned upon them like a savage animal. \\n\\n\"Get out of here, every one of you,\" he howled, \"unless you want to be hammered to death.\" \\n\\n\"Don't you move,\" said Hal. \"You evidently have more right here than he has.\" \\n\\n\"Indeed!\" said Ferris, turning to Hal. \"I wish you would keep your nose out of my affairs.\" \\n\\n\"Don't let him sass you, mister,\" put in one of the urchins. \"He didn't have no cause ter hit Katie.\" \\n\\nFerris pounced upon the boy at once, and cuffed him right and left.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \"numerous requests\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \"important\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \"generosity and strength of the revolution.\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Why was Alan Gross sentence to jail?\"\\n\\nResponse: \"He was accused of drug trafficking\"\\n\\nBased on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?\\n\\nChoose your answer from:\\n a). no.\\n b). yes.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Slabs of lithosphere smash into each other. They move sideways past each other along faults. Where conditions are right, magma rises through solid rock. It's no wonder that rocks experience stress! Rocks respond differently to different types of stress and under different conditions.   Q: What rises through solid rocks where conditions are right?

Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send Me\", \"Wonderful World\", \"Chain Gang\", and \"Twistin' the Night Away\".\\n\\nCooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931. In 1957 he added an \"e\" at the end of his name to signify a new start to his life. He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932-2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents.  The family moved to Chicago in 1933. Cooke attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago, the same school that Nat \"King\" Cole had attended a few years earlier. Sam Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. He first became known as lead singer with the Highway QC's when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group.  In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, founded by Harris, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song \"Jesus Gave Me Water\" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs \"Peace in the Valley\", \"How Far Am I from Canaan?\", \"Jesus Paid the Debt\" and \"One More River\", among many others, some of which he wrote. Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of Cooke.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he get his career started?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Context: Overnight the clouds had rolled in and the summer was dead. I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain. Somebody knocked at the door and I swiveled around to see Pete McGreggor from down the hall. \"Busy?\" he asked. I shook my head and he came in, closing the door behind him. He poured a cup of coffee and sat down across from me. \"Big shakeup last night,\" he said. \"I just got a call to defend one of the Preacher's errand boys.\" \"So they finally got to him,\" I said, remembering the furor that had raged in the newspapers a few months before. The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \"How'd they do it?\" \"It's very hush-hush,\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess. But what I gather is that the thing was pulled off from the inside, from somebody high up in the organization. But nobody knows exactly who it was that sold out.\" \"It'll all come clean at the trial, I suppose.\" He nodded. \"Sooner than that, I expect. The DA told me confidentially that they'll have everything they need by five o'clock tonight. You'll see it all on the evening news.\" A sharp rapping came at the door and Pete stood up. \"You've got business. I'll leave you to it.\" \"It's probably bill collectors,\" I said. \"I'll yell if they get rough.\" He opened the door and pushed past the two policemen that were waiting outside. They were both in uniform, but I only knew one of them. That was Brady, the tall, curly headed one that looked like an Irish middleweight. His partner was dark and nondescript, sporting a Police Academy moustache. Question: The police knocked on the door: Options: - not enough information - After Pete left - Before Pete arrived - After Pete arrived\\nThe answer is:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

After the visits we went to a little garden where the mayoress put on a buffet , although I think they did n't realise how many people were coming because there was n't very much food at all , so we went to a restaurant in the main square & had something to eat . Friday we had more french classes in the morning , then a meeting with the police , which got cancelled , so we went out shopping . Saturday was pretty relaxed . We went food shopping in the big supermarket & it was ridiculously busy . Sunday all the shops are shut , so we spent the day chilling .\\n\\nBased on the preceding passage, choose your answer for question What may be the plausible reason we went to the restaurant ?\\nChoices: a).

With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights.

The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a tenor) is primo uomo.  - Elisabeth Olin née Lillström ( December 1740 -- 26 March 1828 ) , was a Swedish opera singer and a music composer . She performed the leading female role in the inauguration performance of the Royal Swedish Opera in 1773 , and is referred to as the first Swedish Opera prima donna . She was the first female to be made Hovsångare ( 1773 ) , and the first woman to become a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music ( 1782 ) .  - Opera (English plural: \"operas\"; Italian plural: \"opere\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \"tenor high C\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \"leggero\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.  - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \"high A\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \"soprano C\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four, and Alan Rogerson describes the religion's leadership as totalitarian. Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making, the religion's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives. Critics also accuse the religion's leaders of exercising \"intellectual dominance\" over Witnesses, controlling information and creating \"mental isolation\", which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control.\"?\\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Think like you are answering to a five year old.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\n{ { Plot } } Tom plays pool in a deserted pool hall , pocketing two balls by lowdown means and then wakes Jerry up by shooting the 10-ball into the pocket where he is sleeping .  Jerry awakes just in time to avoid the 10-ball and is carried out to the ball return , where the 10 and the 13 smash the mouse between each other .  Jerry is mad and walks up through the pocket , first sees nothing , but after a few steps back to the pocket , he spots Tom perched behind it .  Jerry tries to jump into another corner pocket , but Tom aims a cue ball with so much force that it roll's into the pocket , and spins back out of it and it rolls Jerry backwards to Tom , who has made a ramp with his cue stick for the mouse to slide up .  Jerry stops at the top of the stick and is then blown down by Tom , who then shoots a stream of balls to make the mouse flat .  The whole train rebounds back towards the cat and the balls stack up at Tom's end of the table .  Tom shoots all the balls in succession with his cue , and then tries to shoot Jerry , but the mouse hangs onto the cue tip .  The cat , as if he were saying `` Have it your way '' , chalks up and shoots the 8-ball using Jerry .  The mouse drops off the cue tip and then is upended by the 8-ball rolling in circles , and Tom forces Jerry to jump through the ball rack as if he were a circus performer .  Tom then sets it on fire to add an additional level of torment , and when Jerry accomplishes this with poise , Tom discards the flaming rack and shoots the 8-ball across the table and back . \\n\\nQuestion: \"What makes Jerry to stop at the top of the stick?\"\\n\\nResponse: \"Because he slips\"\\n\\nBased on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one’s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.

Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \"What's the problem?\" Ray asked. \"I have a recalcitrant.\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural. \"Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business. To make them calcitrant.\" \"I know that.\" Pete sounded a little annoyed. There was some commotion in the background, a knocking on doors. How long have Pete and Ray known each other for? - They just met - not enough information - Few month - Few hours\\nThe answer to this question is:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

But the most rewarding reactions to the film, Cooper says, have been from veterans.\\n\\n“It's been incredible, just incredible the amount of response. It’s everything we could have possibly hoped for,” he said. “In the sense of people feeling like even though it's a movie it's accurate enough, and in terms of the emotional and sort of familial sort of sense of reality that it's completely accurate.\"\\n\\nMiller said having Taya on board was key.\\n\\n“She had tons of home videos and we read all of their email correspondence when he was on tour. She kept everything because she never knew whether he'd make it back,” Miller told FOX411. “You know, when you have access to that kind of information you get a side to someone that no one really ever sees. You see the family man, you see how loving he was, and I think that Bradley really brings that heart, that balance between him as the military man but also this soulful, loving father.\"\\n\\nCooper said playing Kyle provided insight into the lives of soldiers and their families.\\n\\n“It was a keyhole into that life,” he said. “One thing that we were able to do was explore this man's life and this woman's life and their children and their family and in doing so hopefully get just a nugget, a kernel of truth, that people who actually have gone through it and are going through it can relate to it and not feel alone.”\\n\\n“American Sniper” opens in theaters nationwide January 16th.\\n\\nFox News Entertainment Producer Ashley Dvorkin covers celebrity news, red carpets, TV, music, and movies.

Earlier this week the Uruguayan striker was hit with the sanction by the English Football Association for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic following the ruling of an Independent Regulatory Commission. The ban's severity sparked fierce criticism from the Liverpool hierarchy. The ban will start with immediate effect, meaning Suarez will play no part in Liverpool's four remaining Premier League matches with the Uruguayan also ruled out for the start of next season.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- Ajax is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Anfield is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Branislav Ivanovic is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- British is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- CNN is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Chelsea is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- David Cameron is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- English Football Association is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Independent Regulatory Commission is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Liverpool is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Luis Suarez is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Premier League is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Suarez is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n- Uruguayan is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard.\\n\\n<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox.  and the situation: Two families thought differently about vaccinations. Dean family vaccinated their children while Moore family didn't.  Answer the following question: Which family exposed their members to pathogens on purpose?\\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nI am currently waiting for peer reviews of two books I’ve worked on: one sole-authored, one co-authored. We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture. Question: Who did the author and their co-authors decide that they should liaise with? Options: - not enough information   - editors   - reviewers   - publishers === The correct answer is\\nThe answer to this question is:<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n   \n",

The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige). The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside. To ensure Veronica's survival Balthazar traps her, with Morgana, in the Grimhold, a large nesting doll. Both facades of Veronica and Morgana are displayed on the outer shell. Before he dies, Merlin tells Balthazar that he must find the child that will be born endowed with all of his powers, the Prime Merlinian, and gives him a small, metal dragon; a symbol of his magic. The Prime Merlinian will be the only one to stop Morgana. Balthazar searches the globe for the Merlinian, with no success. Over time, he battles evil sorcerers and adds them, in layers, to the Grimhold until, finally, he captures Horvath and seals him in the outermost layer.Centuries pass to the year 2000.
